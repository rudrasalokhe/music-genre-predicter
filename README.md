# Music Genre Prediction

This project uses a Decision Tree Classifier to predict the genre of music based on features like age and gender. The model is trained on a dataset (`music.csv`) that includes features such as age and gender to predict the genre of the music.

## Libraries Used
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and reading the CSV file.
- `scikit-learn`: For creating the Decision Tree Classifier model and making predictions.
- `joblib`: For saving and loading the trained model.

## Steps to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required libraries using:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib
